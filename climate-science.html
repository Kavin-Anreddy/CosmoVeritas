      <h2>The Science of Climate Change</h2>
      <p>
        Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. While natural factors have always played a role in Earth's climate, current scientific evidence overwhelmingly shows that human activities—especially the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation—are driving a rapid warming of our planet.
      </p>
      
      <h3>The Greenhouse Effect Explained</h3>
      <p>
        At the heart of climate change is the greenhouse effect. Greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO₂), methane (CH₄), and water vapor trap heat from the sun in our atmosphere, creating a warming blanket around the Earth. Without this natural process, our planet would be inhospitably cold. However, the excessive accumulation of these gases due to human activities intensifies this effect, leading to global warming.

      <h3>Key Factors Driving Climate Change</h3>
      <p>
        Modern industry, transportation, and energy production rely heavily on fossil fuels. The combustion of these fuels releases vast amounts of CO₂ and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. In addition, deforestation reduces the number of trees available to absorb CO₂, further exacerbating the problem. The Keeling Curve shows how humans hace caused CO₂ emissions to increase drastically.

      <h3>Climate Feedbacks and Amplifiers</h3>
      <p>
        Beyond the basic greenhouse effect, several feedback mechanisms amplify climate change. For instance, as polar ice melts, less sunlight is reflected back into space, leading to further warming—a process known as the ice-albedo feedback. Similarly, warming oceans release methane from underwater deposits, which further accelerates warming.

      <h3>Debunking Climate Misinformation</h3>
      <p>
        Despite overwhelming evidence, several myths continue to circulate about climate change. Some common claims include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>"Climate change is a natural cycle."</strong> While natural cycles exist, current changes are occurring at a rate far beyond natural variability. Multiple lines of evidence—from ice core data to satellite measurements—demonstrate that recent warming is driven primarily by human activities.</li>
        <li><strong>"There is no scientific consensus."</strong> Over 97% of climate scientists agree that human-induced climate change is real. This consensus is supported by extensive research, peer-reviewed studies, and reports from organizations such as the IPCC.</li>
        <li><strong>"Global warming stopped in recent years."</strong> Short-term fluctuations in temperature do occur, but the long-term trend shows a clear, continuous increase in global temperatures. Variability due to natural phenomena like El Niño does not negate the overall warming trend.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        It is critical to rely on peer-reviewed studies and reputable scientific organizations when evaluating these claims. The consensus among experts is that climate change is real, primarily driven by human activity, and poses significant risks to our environment and society.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Recent Trends and Future Projections</h3>
      <p>
        Recent measurements indicate that global average temperatures continue to rise, with increased frequency of extreme weather events such as heatwaves, hurricanes, and heavy rainfall. Climate models project that if greenhouse gas emissions continue at the current pace, the Earth could warm by several degrees Celsius by the end of this century, leading to widespread ecological, social, and economic impacts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mitigation strategies include transitioning to renewable energy sources, enhancing energy efficiency, and implementing policies that reduce deforestation. In parallel, adaptation measures—such as building resilient infrastructure and improving disaster preparedness—are essential to cope with the inevitable changes.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>
        The science behind climate change is robust and multifaceted. Understanding the greenhouse effect, the role of human activities, and the feedback mechanisms that amplify warming is essential. By debunking persistent myths and relying on sound scientific evidence, we can take informed actions to mitigate and adapt to climate change, ensuring a sustainable future.
