      <h2>RFK Jr. Downplays Texas Measles Outbreak Despite Child’s Death</h2>
      <img src="https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/rfk-jr-measles-outbreak-cabinet.jpg" alt="RFK Jr. at a Cabinet meeting" class="full-article-image">
      <p>
        In a controversial statement amid growing concern over a severe measles outbreak in West Texas, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. dismissed the situation as “not unusual.” This remark came just days after state officials confirmed the first measles-related death in the U.S. since 2015—a school-aged, unvaccinated child in Lubbock, Texas.
      </p>
      <p>
        The outbreak, which began in late January, has now reached 124 confirmed cases across nine Texas counties, with additional cases reported in neighboring New Mexico. The majority of infections are among unvaccinated children, particularly in the under-vaccinated communities of Gaines County, where vaccination exemption rates have surged in recent years.
      </p>
      <p>
        During a Cabinet meeting, Kennedy stated, “We are following the measles epidemic every day. Incidentally, there have been four measles outbreaks this year. In this country last year there were 16. So it’s not unusual. We have measles outbreaks every year.” Critics argue that such remarks downplay the gravity of the outbreak, especially given that the virus can lead to severe complications—including pneumonia, brain swelling, and death.
      </p>
      <p>
        Local health officials at Covenant Children’s Hospital in Lubbock have reported that many of the hospitalized children are experiencing significant respiratory distress. Dr. Lara Johnson, the hospital’s chief medical officer, refuted Kennedy’s claim that hospitalizations were primarily for “quarantine purposes,” emphasizing that the patients are receiving critical care.
      </p>
      <p>
        Public health experts warn that the current outbreak is a stark reminder of the consequences of falling vaccination rates. Once nearly eradicated in the U.S. due to comprehensive vaccination programs, measles has resurfaced as vaccination coverage dipped below the critical 95% threshold in several communities following the COVID-19 pandemic.
      </p>
      <p>
        As debates continue over vaccine mandates and public health policies, many are urging a more proactive response. Representative Teresa Leger Fernández has called for intensified vaccine campaigns in the affected areas, noting that even a single measles death is a tragic failure of public health protection.
